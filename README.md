1. Introduction

Object detection plays an important role in computer vision. It has a variety of applications, including security detection, vehicle recognition, and service robots. With the continuous improvement of public databases and the development of deep learning, object detection has witnessed significant
breakthroughs. However, the object detection of sweeping robots during operations should consider various factors, including the camera angle, indoor scenery, and identification of object category. To the best of our knowledge, no corresponding database on these conditions has been developed. In this study, we propose a large-scale publicly available benchmark dataset called object detection for sweeping robots in home scenes (ODSRIHS). The dataset has 6,000 images and 16,409 instances of 14 object categories.
